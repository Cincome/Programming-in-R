Repo for R Programming class in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera

# Project 1
The data for this project is from pollutant monitoring of fine particulate matter at 332 locations within the US. 

This project required creating three different scripts. The first script calculates the mean across all of the locations for the chosen pollutant.  The second script reads the directory of files and tells the number of complete obersvations. The third script calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate recordings for locations above a specified threshold.

# Project 2
The second project was to create a script to cache the inverse of a matrix.  See the README.md in the Project 2 file for the assignment instructions.

# Project 3
This project required writing four different scripts to analyze hospital data from the Department of Health and Human Services. The first script plots the 30 day mortality rate for heart attacks. The second script finds the best hospital in a state for a certain outcome. The third script ranked the hospitals in a state by outcome. The fourth script ranks the hospitals for all of the states.
